This project was undertaken within the scope of a school assignment, in collaboration with Sena ATAKAN. Her contribution was instrumental in the success and outcome of this project. I would like to express my deepest gratitude for her support and hard work, which have been invaluable throughout the journey. Her dedication and expertise have played a significant role in shaping the final result, and I am truly grateful for her contributions.

for the auto-encoder script, we used the output model of Abdullah KÃ¶ksal (reference repository:https://github.com/akoksal/Turkish-Word2Vec)

download the model from the following link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IBMTAGtZ4DakSCyAoA4j7Ch0Ft1aFoww 

place it into the root folder, then start the script.
